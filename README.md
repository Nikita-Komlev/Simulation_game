# Simulation_game
A step-by-step simulation of a 2D world inhabited by herbivores and predators.
In addition to creatures, the world contains resources (grass) that herbivores feed on, and static objects that cannot be interacted with—they simply take up space.

The 2D world is represented as an NxM matrix, with each creature or object occupying an entire cell; it is not possible for multiple objects/creatures to occupy the same cell.
